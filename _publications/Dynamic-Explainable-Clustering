title: "Dynamic Algorithm for Explainable $$k$$-medians Clustering under the $$l_p$$ Norm"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/Dynamic-Explainable-Clustering
excerpt: 'We study the problem of explainable $$k$$-medians clustering introduced by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020). In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into $$k$$ clusters while minimizing the $$k$$-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We design an accurate static explainable clustering algorithm for the $$k$$-medians objective under the $$\ell_p$$ norm for every $$p \geq 1$$ and then show how to implement it in the dynamic setting, where the input is gradually revealed to the algorithm.'
